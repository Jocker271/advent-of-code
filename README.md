# Advent of Code (Python)
This are my solutions for the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## About this repository
Of course, many solutions can be written shorter and probably more efficiently, but on the one hand I want to write code that is easy to understand and on the other hand spare [PyLint's](https://pylint.org/) nerves. ðŸ˜‰

As I only came across this project in 2020, some tasks are still unresolved. In addition, every year I have the problem of not finding time for the tasks after a few days, so that there is a backlog that can only be made up later. However, I am willing to catch up on all tasks as soon as my time and motivation allow.

## Template
To avoid creating the new files every day, I wrote a script ([template.py](template.py)) that creates all the necessary folders and files of the entered year.
